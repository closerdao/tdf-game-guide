# üå≥ WORLD BUILDING

**SHAPE THE LANDSCAPE!** In the Regeneration Game, the physical world is your canvas for ecological restoration and regenerative design.

> *"We aren't just playing on the land‚Äîwe're playing with the land as our most important ally."*

## üå± REGENERATIVE PRINCIPLES

Our approach to land stewardship follows core regenerative principles:

- **Observe Before Acting** - Learn the patterns before intervening
- **Stack Functions** - Design elements that serve multiple purposes
- **Work With Nature** - Align with natural processes rather than fighting them
- **Capture & Store Energy** - Harvest and preserve resources when abundant
- **Value Diversity** - Cultivate resilience through biological and cultural variety

For a deeper dive into these principles, see [Principles](principles.md).

## üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è STEWARDSHIP PRACTICES

| PRACTICE | DESCRIPTION | PLAYER INTERACTION |
|----------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Food Forests** | Multi-layered edible ecosystems | Planting, maintenance, harvesting |
| **Water Management** | Swales, ponds, and rainwater systems | Design, implementation, monitoring |
| **Soil Building** | Composting, mulching, cover cropping | Material collection, application, testing |
| **Habitat Creation** | Wildlife corridors and biodiversity zones | Construction, observation, protection |
| **Carbon Sequestration** | Trees, perennials, and soil organic matter | Planting, management, measurement |

## üîç ECOLOGICAL MONITORING

We track our impact through careful observation and measurement:

- **Biodiversity Surveys** - Tracking species presence and abundance
- **Soil Testing** - Measuring organic matter, nutrients, and microbial life
- **Water Quality** - Monitoring purity and availability
- **Carbon Accounting** - Tracking sequestration and emissions

For details on our monitoring practices, see [Monitoring](monitoring.md).

## üéÆ PLAYER IMPACT

Every player action affects the game world:

- **Regenerative** ‚Üí Increases biodiversity, soil health, water retention
- **Extractive** ‚Üí Decreases ecosystem health and resilience
- **Neutral** ‚Üí Maintains current state without improvement or harm
