# üå≥ Land Stewardship

**OASA-Aligned Ecological Care** TDF is a human habitat that shares and interacts with surrounding ecosystems according to [OASA regenerative principles](https://oasa.earth). At least 50% of land is reserved for rewilding, with safety and comfort for people as design goals.

> *"We work with the land as our most important ally, within the bounds of ecological integrity."*

**Constitutional Framework**: All land stewardship activities must comply with the [OASA constitution](https://oasa.earth) and may require approval by OASA's General Meeting for major changes.

## üå± Regenerative Principles

Our approach to land stewardship follows core regenerative principles:

- **Observe Before Acting** - Learn the patterns before intervening
- **Stack Functions** - Design elements that serve multiple purposes, emphasizing closed loops
- **Work With Nature** - Align with natural processes including reforestation, rotational grazing, and planting local varieties
- **Capture & Store Energy** - Harvest and preserve resources when abundant, including geothermal and wind (e.g., kite systems) and reusing waste heat
- **Value Diversity** - Cultivate resilience through non-invasive, locally suitable species and pest management
- **Safety** - Ensure human safety and comfort in all land interactions
- **Good Neighbourliness** - Maintain positive relationships with surrounding communities
- **Balanced Diversity** - Balance diversity with suitability and safety

For a deeper dive into these principles, see [Principles](principles.md).

## üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Stewardship Practices

| Practice | Description | Participation Opportunities |
|----------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Food Forests** | Multi-layered edible ecosystems | Planting, maintenance, harvesting |
| **Water Management** | Swales, ponds, and rainwater systems | Design, implementation, monitoring |
| **Soil Building** | Composting, mulching, cover cropping | Material collection, application, testing |
| **Habitat Creation** | Wildlife corridors and biodiversity zones | Construction, observation, protection |
| **Carbon Sequestration** | Trees, perennials, and soil organic matter | Planting, management, measurement |

## üîç Ecological Monitoring

We track our impact through careful observation and measurement:

- **Biodiversity Surveys** - Tracking species presence and abundance
- **Soil Testing** - Measuring organic matter, nutrients, and microbial life
- **Water Quality** - Monitoring purity and availability
- **Carbon Accounting** - Tracking sequestration and emissions

For details on our monitoring practices, see [Monitoring](monitoring.md).

## üåø Community Impact

TDF aims to be regenerative wherever possible, neutral if not, and never extractive. We recognize embodied impacts of imported materials and commit to closing loops. Every action affects the ecosystem:

- **Regenerative** ‚Üí Increases biodiversity, soil health, water retention
- **Neutral** ‚Üí Maintains current state without improvement or harm
- **Never Extractive** ‚Üí We avoid actions that decrease ecosystem health and resilience

*"The true measure of our success is the thriving of all life forms in our care."*
