# üîç ECOLOGICAL MONITORING

**TRACK YOUR IMPACT!** In the Regeneration Game, we measure what matters‚Äîthe health and vitality of the living systems we steward.

> *"What gets measured gets managed. What gets monitored gets regenerated."*

## üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è MONITORING QUESTS

Our ecological monitoring system tracks key indicators of ecosystem health:

| INDICATOR                | WHAT WE MEASURE                       | HOW WE MEASURE                       | FREQUENCY |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | --------- |
| **Biodiversity**         | Species presence and abundance        | Surveys, camera traps, iNaturalist   | Seasonal  |
| **Soil Health**          | Organic matter, nutrients, biology    | Lab tests, in-field observations     | Bi-annual |
| **Water Systems**        | Quality, quantity, infiltration       | Water tests, flow measurements       | Monthly   |
| **Carbon Sequestration** | Biomass, soil carbon                  | Open Forest Protocol, soil tests     | Annual    |
| **Ecosystem Function**   | Pollination, predation, decomposition | Observation plots, indicator species | Seasonal  |

## üéÆ PLAYER PARTICIPATION

Every player can join monitoring quests:

- **Biodiversity Surveys** - Document plants and animals you encounter
- **Soil Sampling** - Collect and prepare soil for testing
- **Water Monitoring** - Check water quality in ponds and streams
- **Photo Monitoring** - Take pictures at fixed points to track change
- **Phenology Tracking** - Record seasonal events like flowering and fruiting

## üìä DATA VISUALIZATION

We transform monitoring data into accessible insights:

- **Digital Twin** - Virtual representation of the physical land
- **Seasonal Reports** - Regular updates on ecosystem health
- **Regeneration Dashboard** - Real-time metrics of key indicators
- **Before/After Comparisons** - Visual evidence of transformation

## üéØ REGENERATIVE TARGETS

Our monitoring helps track progress toward specific goals:

- **Increase biodiversity** by 30% within 5 years
- **Build soil organic matter** to 5%+ in agricultural areas
- **Achieve water self-sufficiency** through rainwater harvesting
- **Sequester 10+ tons of carbon** per hectare annually
- **Create habitat corridors** connecting all parts of the land

## üîÆ ADAPTIVE MANAGEMENT

Monitoring feeds directly into our land management decisions:

1. **Observe** - Collect monitoring data
2. **Interpret** - Analyze patterns and trends
3. **Adapt** - Modify practices based on findings
4. **Implement** - Apply new approaches
5. **Re-monitor** - Measure the effects of changes

## üåê OPEN SCIENCE

Our monitoring follows open science principles:

- **Transparent Methods** - Clear documentation of how we measure
- **Open Data** - Accessible datasets for community use
- **Citizen Science** - Participation open to all players
- **Knowledge Sharing** - Regular workshops on findings
- **Carbon Verification** - We track carbon sequestration through [Open Forest Protocol](https://atlas.openforestprotocol.org/1660749236393)
