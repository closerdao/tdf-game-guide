# Ecological Monitoring at TDF

To live regeneratively means to continuously learn from the land.
TDF tracks key ecological indicators to understand our impact â€” and course correct when needed.

### ðŸ“Š What We Monitor
1. **Soil Health**
   - Organic matter content
   - Soil compaction and porosity
   - Microbial diversity (as feasible)

2. **Water Systems**
   - Rain capture and storage rates
   - Greywater reuse and discharge quality
   - Seasonal flow of swales and ponds

3. **Biodiversity**
   - Species richness (plants, insects, birds)
   - Pollinator populations
   - Tree cover and forest age

4. **Carbon & Biomass**
   - Carbon sequestration estimates (via plantings) - via [Open Forest Protocol](https://atlas.openforestprotocol.org/1660749236393)
   - Biomass growth in syntropic/agroforestry zones

### ðŸ§­ Reporting Cycle
- Monitoring happens **annually** at the end of each season cycle
- Results are shared with:
  - The TDF community
  - The OASA Association
  - Open-source networks (optional)

### ðŸ§© When Things Go Wrong
If signs of degradation appear:
- **Alert** the TDF Team and OASA within 1 week
- **Develop** a remediation plan within 1 month
- **Involve** the community in repair and restoration efforts

Our goal is not perfection â€” but presence.
We grow by observing, adapting, and learning from the feedback of the land ðŸŒ¿
