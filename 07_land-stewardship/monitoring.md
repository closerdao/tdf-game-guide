# üîç Ecological Monitoring

**MEASURING IMPACT** At TDF, we measure what matters‚Äîthe health and vitality of the living systems we steward.

> *"What gets measured gets managed. What gets monitored gets regenerated."*

## üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è MONITORING ACTIVITIES

Our ecological monitoring system tracks key indicators aligned with [OASA regenerative principles](https://oasa.earth):

| INDICATOR                | WHAT WE MEASURE                       | HOW WE MEASURE                       | FREQUENCY |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | --------- |
| **Soil Health**          | Organic matter, microbiology, pH, water content | Lab tests, sensors, in-field observations | Bi-annual |
| **Soil Building**        | Chop-and-drop activities, compost application, biochar volumes | Measurement, tracking, biomass calculations | Monthly   |
| **Water Systems**        | Rainfall capture, greywater treatment, infiltration rates | Water tests, flow sensors, telemetry | Monthly   |
| **Water Self-Sufficiency** | Aquifer use, rainwater harvesting capacity | Usage tracking, storage monitoring | Monthly   |
| **Air Quality**          | Carbon sequestration rates, no-burn compliance | Tree growth measurement, biochar tracking | Annual    |
| **Waste Management**     | Waste generation, recycling rates, compost output | Waste audits, tracking systems | Monthly   |
| **Biodiversity**         | Species presence, 50% wild land maintenance | Surveys, camera traps, iNaturalist | Seasonal  |
| **Wildlife Corridors**   | Habitat connectivity, agricultural protection | Mapping, monitoring, fence maintenance | Seasonal  |
| **Resources**            | Renewable energy production, building footprint, local sourcing | Energy monitoring, material tracking | Monthly   |
| **Community**            | Governance participation, equity perception | Surveys, participation tracking | Quarterly |

## üîÑ COMMUNITY PARTICIPATION

Community members can join monitoring activities after completing onboarding:

- **Biodiversity Surveys** - Document plants and animals you encounter
- **Soil Sampling** - Collect and prepare soil for testing
- **Water Monitoring** - Check water quality in ponds and streams
- **Photo Monitoring** - Take pictures at fixed points to track change
- **Phenology Tracking** - Record seasonal events like flowering and fruiting

**Onboarding Required**: All participants must complete orientation before joining monitoring activities.

## üìä DATA VISUALIZATION

We transform monitoring data into accessible insights:

- **Digital Twin** - Virtual representation of the physical land
- **Seasonal Reports** - Regular updates on ecosystem health
- **Regeneration Dashboard** - Real-time metrics of key indicators
- **Before/After Comparisons** - Visual evidence of transformation
- **Infographics** - Visual representations of key data and trends

## üéØ REGENERATIVE TARGETS

Our monitoring helps track progress toward [OASA-aligned goals](https://oasa.earth):

### Soil Targets
- **Build soil organic matter** to 5%+ in agricultural areas
- **Return 30% of pruned biomass** to soil annually
- **Increase biochar application** to 2 tons per hectare annually
- **Maintain living plant cover** on 90%+ of land year-round

### Water Targets
- **Achieve water self-sufficiency** through rainwater harvesting (prioritize over aquifer use)
- **Treat 100% of greywater** through biological systems
- **Capture 80% of rainfall** in landscape features
- **Minimize aquifer extraction** to <10% of total water use

### Air Targets
- **Sequester 10+ tons of carbon** per hectare annually
- **Maintain zero toxic burning** policy compliance
- **Increase forest cover** by 20% within 5 years
- **Track biochar carbon storage** annually

### Waste Targets
- **Achieve 90% waste diversion** from landfill
- **Eliminate single-use plastics** from community operations
- **Compost 100% of organic waste** generated on-site
- **Maintain zero hazardous materials** on land

### Biodiversity Targets
- **Maintain 50% wild/rewilded land** minimum
- **Increase native species** by 30% within 5 years
- **Create wildlife corridors** connecting all land areas
- **Remove invasive species** from 90% of affected areas

### Resource Targets
- **Generate 100% renewable energy** for community needs
- **Limit building footprint** to 5% of total land area
- **Source 80% of materials** locally or sustainably
- **Increase plant-based meals** to 70% of community food

### Community Targets
- **Achieve 80% governance participation** among eligible members
- **Maintain 90%+ satisfaction** with equity and inclusion
- **Complete 100% of training** requirements for new members
- **Conduct quarterly outreach** to local communities

## üîÆ ADAPTIVE MANAGEMENT

Monitoring feeds directly into our land management decisions:

1. **Observe** - Collect monitoring data
2. **Interpret** - Analyze patterns and trends
3. **Adapt** - Adapt where necessary based on findings
4. **Implement** - Apply new approaches
5. **Re-monitor** - Measure the effects of changes

## üåê OPEN SCIENCE

Our monitoring follows open science principles:

- **Transparent Methods** - Clear documentation of how we measure
- **Open Data** - Accessible datasets for community use
- **Citizen Science** - Participation open to all community members
- **Knowledge Sharing** - Regular workshops on findings
- **Carbon Verification** - We track carbon sequestration through [Open Forest Protocol](https://atlas.openforestprotocol.org/1660749236393)
- **University Partnerships** - We invite partnerships with universities and research institutes
- **External Publishing** - We encourage publishing findings externally to contribute to scientific knowledge
