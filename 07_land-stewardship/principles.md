# üå± OASA Regenerative Principles

**CONSTITUTIONAL FOUNDATION** TDF operates within the [OASA constitution](https://oasa.earth) framework, applying seven core regenerative principles that shape how we interact with the land and each other.

> *"We work with the land as our most important ally, within the bounds of ecological integrity."*

## üåç THE SEVEN REGENERATIVE PRINCIPLES

These principles mirror the [OASA constitution's regenerative principles](https://oasa.earth) and form the foundation of our approach to land stewardship:

### 1. Soil: Life-filled and Fertile
**Maintaining living plant cover and building soil health**

- **Living Plant Cover** - Maintain continuous plant cover to protect soil from erosion
- **Minimize Disturbance** - Avoid unnecessary soil disruption and compaction
- **Avoid Synthetic Fertilizers** - Use only natural, organic soil amendments
- **Compost and Nutrient Recycling** - Encourage composting and nutrient cycling systems
- **Biomass Return** - Commit to returning at least 30% of pruned biomass to the soil
- **Biochar and Vermicomposting** - Build soil through biochar application and vermicomposting
- **Soil Building** - Increase organic matter to store carbon and nutrients

### 2. Water: Healthy Systems and Cycles
**Capturing, storing, and treating water sustainably**

- **Rainfall Capture** - Capture and store rainfall via swales, ponds, and terraces
- **Greywater Treatment** - Separate and biologically treat greywater and blackwater
- **Rainwater Priority** - Prioritize rainwater harvesting over aquifer extraction
- **Greywater Recycling** - Implement comprehensive greywater recycling systems
- **No Chlorine** - Discourage chlorine use in water treatment
- **Water Harvesting** - Slow, spread, and sink water into the landscape

### 3. Air: Clean and Restorative
**Promoting clean air and carbon sequestration**

- **No Toxic Burning** - Ban open burning of toxic materials
- **Reforestation** - Promote reforestation and afforestation for carbon sequestration
- **Biochar Carbon Lock** - Use biochar to lock carbon and improve soil water retention
- **Clean Energy** - Ensure energy systems avoid emitting harmful pollutants
- **Carbon Sequestration** - Track and maximize carbon storage in soil and biomass

### 4. Waste: A Non-Waste Mentality
**Eliminating waste and promoting circular systems**

- **Zero Waste Goal** - Seek to eliminate waste through design and behavior
- **No Single-Use Plastics** - Avoid single-use plastics and synthetic materials
- **Accessible Recycling** - Provide comprehensive recycling systems
- **Upcycling** - Transform waste materials into useful products
- **Organic Waste Recovery** - Recover organic waste through composting
- **Pollution Prevention** - Prevent pollution at the source

### 5. Rewilding and Biodiversity
**Protecting and enhancing natural ecosystems**

- **50% Wild Land** - Keep at least 50% of TDF's land wild or rewilded
- **Native Species** - Plant native species and support local biodiversity
- **Diverse Crops** - Employ diverse crops and food forests
- **Ancient Tree Conservation** - Conserve and protect ancient trees
- **Invasive Species Removal** - Remove invasive species systematically
- **Rotational Grazing** - Use rotational or mob grazing to improve diversity
- **Balanced Diversity** - Balance diversity with suitability and safety
- **Wildlife Corridors** - Maintain corridors for wildlife connectivity

### 6. Resources: Renewable and Sustainable
**Using renewable resources and sustainable materials**

- **Renewable Energy** - Emphasize solar, wind, and biomass energy systems
- **5% Building Limit** - Limit built structures to 5% of total land area
- **Local Natural Materials** - Select local natural materials (wood, straw, clay, cork)
- **Biodiversity-Supporting Buildings** - Design buildings with green roofs and vertical gardens
- **Local Sourcing** - Source food and materials locally when possible
- **Reduced Meat Consumption** - Promote plant-based diets and sustainable protein sources
- **Geothermal and Wind** - Utilize geothermal and kite wind systems

### 7. Community: Equitable, Resilient and Open
**Building equitable and resilient community systems**

- **Equivalence** - Stress equivalence and consent-based decision-making
- **Rule-Making Power** - Empower those affected by rules to propose them
- **Restorative Justice** - Use restorative justice and mediation for conflicts
- **Open Knowledge** - Share knowledge openly and transparently
- **Local Collaboration** - Collaborate with local communities and stakeholders
- **Mutual Aid** - Cultivate resilience through mutual aid and local economies
- **Safety and Good Neighborliness** - Maintain safety and positive community relationships
- **Active Governance** - Encourage active engagement in governance processes

## üåÄ REGENERATIVE ETHICS

These principles are guided by three core ethics:

- **Earth Care** - Protecting and regenerating natural systems
- **People Care** - Meeting human needs with dignity and respect
- **Fair Share** - Setting limits and redistributing surplus

*"These principles aren't just guidelines‚Äîthey're the foundation that transforms our relationship with the land."*
