# Land Stewardship Principles at TDF

At TDF, land is not a backdrop — it's a living partner. Stewarding this land regeneratively means making decisions that support all life, now and for generations to come.

These principles, inspired by the OASA framework, are foundational to everything we do on-site.

### 🌱 Regenerative Core Principles
1. **Soil Health** — Build and protect soil through composting, mulching, syntropic agriculture, and no-dig practices.
2. **Water Cycle Restoration** — Design for retention, infiltration, and flow using swales, ponds, greywater reuse, and rainwater harvesting.
3. **Biodiversity Enhancement** — Plant native and beneficial species, support pollinators, and create habitats.
4. **Circular Waste Systems** — Treat waste as a resource through composting, upcycling, and reusing materials.
5. **Low-Impact Building** — Use natural or reclaimed materials and minimize impermeable surfaces.
6. **Community as Ecology** — Human systems mirror natural systems: interdependence, feedback loops, decentralization.
7. **Living by Example** — TDF exists to prototype new ways of living regeneratively and openly share what we learn.

### 📏 Regenerative Boundaries & Commitments
- Maintain **50% of land as wild or rewilding** zone
- Limit built surfaces to **no more than 5%** of total land area
- Commit to **ongoing reforestation, water retention, and soil building**
- Monitor and report annually on soil, water, and biodiversity health

---

### 📊 Accountability
- Ecological indicators are reviewed yearly
- If degradation is observed:
  - Report is sent to OASA within one week
  - Remediation plan created within one month
  - Community is involved in action and learning

Land stewardship is a spiritual, ecological, and cultural practice. At TDF, we don’t own the land — we belong to it 🌍
