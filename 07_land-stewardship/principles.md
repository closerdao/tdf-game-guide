# 🌱 Regenerative Principles

**ECOLOGICAL FOUNDATION** The TDF community is guided by powerful principles that shape how we interact with the land and each other.

> *"We work with the land as our most important ally."*

## 🧙‍♂️ CORE PRINCIPLES

These principles form the foundation of our approach to land stewardship:

### 1. Observe Before Acting
- **Watch & Interact** - Study patterns before intervening
- **Seasonal Cycles** - Understand how the land changes through time
- **Energy Flows** - Map how water, sunlight, and nutrients move
- **Existing Life** - Identify what already thrives here

### 2. Stack Functions
- **Multiple Yields** - Design elements that serve many purposes
- **Integrated Systems** - Connect outputs of one system to inputs of another
- **Resource Efficiency** - Maximize value from each element
- **Resilient Design** - Create redundancy through diversity

### 3. Work With Nature
- **Natural Patterns** - Mimic successful ecological designs
- **Succession Planning** - Understand how ecosystems evolve over time
- **Minimal Intervention** - Use the smallest change for the largest effect
- **Biological Resources** - Prefer living solutions over technological ones

### 4. Capture & Store Energy
- **Water Harvesting** - Slow, spread, and sink water into the landscape
- **Soil Building** - Increase organic matter to store carbon and nutrients
- **Perennial Systems** - Establish plants that produce for many years
- **Appropriate Technology** - Use renewable energy and passive design

### 5. Value Diversity
- **Biodiversity** - Cultivate many species for ecosystem resilience
- **Cultural Diversity** - Honor different perspectives and knowledge systems
- **Functional Diversity** - Include elements that serve different roles
- **Genetic Diversity** - Preserve heirloom and local varieties

| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Observe Before Acting**  | Site analysis, observation logs              | Mapping, journaling, phenology tracking                |
| **Stack Functions**        | Design challenges, system integration        | Creating multi-purpose elements, connecting systems    |
| **Work With Nature**       | Biomimicry, succession planning              | Forest gardening, companion planting                   |
| **Capture & Store Energy** | Resource management, infrastructure building | Water system design, soil building, solar installation |
| **Value Diversity**        | Biodiversity initiatives, cultural exchange  | Planting diverse species, sharing knowledge            |

## 🌀 REGENERATIVE ETHICS

These principles are guided by three core ethics:

- **Earth Care** - Protecting and regenerating natural systems
- **People Care** - Meeting human needs with dignity and respect
- **Fair Share** - Setting limits and redistributing surplus

*"These principles aren't just guidelines—they're the foundation that transforms our relationship with the land."*
