# Game Guide

**Welcome** to the TDF Game Guide. This guide is your map to our regenerative human habitat‚Äîa living experiment where we play at building a different future.

## üå± Why We Exist

**Regeneration**: TDF exists to regenerate ecosystems and demonstrate that humans can live in ways that increase biodiversity, soil fertility and water security. We are part of a global movement to build life-sustaining systems.

**Community Experimentation**: We see our community as an evolving experiment. The "game" allows participants to learn cooperative living, develop new governance models, and explore alternative economies.

**Open Source for the Planet**: Our goal is to share what we learn, creating replicable templates for other projects. We are a node within the OASA network, stewarding land for the commons and refusing extractive systems.

Imagine yourself contributing to a living laboratory where everyone participates in shaping the rules and culture.

## üéØ Mission Statement

Traditional Dream Factory is a regenerative human habitat in Abela, Portugal. We collaborate to create thriving ecosystems for humans and nature, build circular resource flows, and co-design systems that can be shared and replicated. Our mission is to transform how we live‚Äîshifting from extractive habits to regenerative practices‚Äîwhile documenting and sharing our journey with the world.

This Game Guide unifies our pink paper, white paper, visitor guide, and other documentation into a comprehensive resource for community participation.

## üå± OASA Constitution Reference

**Part of the OASA Network** TDF operates as part of the wider OASA network. All projects must adhere to the [OASA constitution](https://oasa.earth) and its regenerative principles.

**Mission Alignment** The OASA constitution's mission is to steward land for the commons and refuse extractive systems. This Game Guide summarises and applies those principles locally at TDF, ensuring our community practices align with the broader network's standards.

**Constitutional Framework** Our local governance operates within OASA's constitutional framework, with certain decisions requiring approval by OASA's General Meeting and guardians of nature.

## üìñ About This Guide

This Game Guide is a living rulebook that governs the "game" of TDF. It describes how community roles, governance and systems work, and invites participation in shaping and updating the rules via the DAO. The guide encourages people to see it as a dynamic tool: not fixed rules but a framework that evolves as we learn.

## üöÄ How to Use This Guide

**Start with the introductory pages** to understand TDF's mission and basic concepts, then dive deeper into specific topic files that interest you. Follow governance procedures for proposing changes to the guide.

### üìã Reading Strategies

**For New Visitors:**
1. Start with the main [README.md](../README.md)
2. Read the [Introduction](../01_introduction/README.md) section
3. Explore [Community Living](../06_community-living/README.md) to understand daily life

**For Prospective Citizens:**
1. Study the [Citizenship](../02_roles-and-stakeholders/citizen.md) section
2. Dive deep into [Governance](../03_governance/README.md)
3. Understand the [Token System](../05_token-economy/README.md)

**For Active Contributors:**
1. Focus on [Land Stewardship](../07_land-stewardship/README.md)
2. Master the [Token System](../05_token-economy/README.md)
3. Engage with specific systems relevant to your contributions

**This Guide Is Not:**
- A fixed set of rules (we evolve)
- A legal contract (see the Operating Agreement for that)
- A substitute for direct community interaction

## üèõÔ∏è Key Concepts

**DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization)**: Our governance structure that enables community members to propose, vote on, and implement decisions collectively. [Learn more about governance ‚Üí](../03_governance/README.md)

**OASA**: Our ecological oversight body that ensures all community activities align with regenerative principles and environmental protection. [Learn more about land stewardship ‚Üí](../07_land-stewardship/README.md)

## üå± Measuring Success

We encourage exploration of four growth areas rather than focusing on traditional metrics:

- **Personal Growth** - Developing new skills, awareness, and capabilities
- **Community Impact** - Contributing to collective flourishing and mutual support
- **Ecological Regeneration** - Helping restore natural systems and biodiversity
- **Cultural Creation** - Co-creating meaningful experiences, practices, and knowledge


## üîÑ Guide Updates

Changes to the guide must go through governance (Charmverse discussion ‚Üí Snapshot vote). See the [Governance section](../03_governance/) for details on how to propose changes.
