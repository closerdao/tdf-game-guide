# 📜 Introduction

**Welcome** to the Traditional Dream Factory (TDF) Community Guide. This section will help you understand our regenerative human habitat and how our community works.

## 🎯 Mission Statement

Traditional Dream Factory is a regenerative human habitat in Abela, Portugal, where people collaborate to create thriving ecosystems for humans and nature. This guide unifies our pink paper, white paper, visitor guide, and other documentation into a comprehensive resource for community participation.

## 🌱 OASA Constitution Reference

**Part of the OASA Network** TDF operates as part of the wider OASA network. All projects must adhere to the [OASA constitution](https://oasa.earth) and its regenerative principles.

**Mission Alignment** The OASA constitution's mission is to steward land for the commons and refuse extractive systems. This Game Guide summarises and applies those principles locally at TDF, ensuring our community practices align with the broader network's standards.

**Constitutional Framework** Our local governance operates within OASA's constitutional framework, with certain decisions requiring approval by OASA's General Meeting and guardians of nature.

## 📖 About This Guide

This guide documents how our community functions and evolves over time.

**This Guide:**
- Explains how our community operates
- Describes roles, governance, and systems
- Updates as our community learns and grows

**This Guide Is Not:**
- A fixed set of rules (we evolve)
- A legal contract (see the Operating Agreement for that)
- A substitute for direct community interaction

## 🏛️ Key Concepts

**DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization)**: Our governance structure that enables community members to propose, vote on, and implement decisions collectively. [Learn more about governance →](../03_governance/README.md)

**OASA**: Our ecological oversight body that ensures all community activities align with regenerative principles and environmental protection. [Learn more about land stewardship →](../07_land-stewardship/README.md)

## 🌱 Measuring Success

We encourage exploration of four growth areas rather than focusing on traditional metrics:

- **Personal Growth** - Developing new skills, awareness, and capabilities
- **Community Impact** - Contributing to collective flourishing and mutual support
- **Ecological Regeneration** - Helping restore natural systems and biodiversity
- **Cultural Creation** - Co-creating meaningful experiences, practices, and knowledge


## 🔄 Guide Updates

Changes to the guide must go through governance (Charmverse discussion → Snapshot vote). See the [Governance section](../03_governance/) for details on how to propose changes.
