# ðŸ“œ GAME RULES

**GREETINGS, ADVENTURER!** You've discovered the guide to the TDF Game.

> *"The rules are simple: regenerate more than you consume."*

## ðŸŽ² HOW TO READ THIS GUIDE

This isn't your ordinary rulebook. It's a living codex that evolves as players discover new strategies and paths through the game world.

**This Guide Is:**
- Your quest log and rulebook for the regeneration adventure
- A map of character classes, game mechanics, and world lore
- A living document that evolves with player discoveries

**This Guide Is Not:**
- Carved in stone (the game evolves!)
- A legal contract (see the Operating Agreement for that)
- A substitute for real-time player interaction
