# ðŸ“œ Introduction

**Welcome** to the TDF Community Guide introduction. This section will help you understand how our community works.

## ðŸ“– About This Guide

This guide documents how our community functions and evolves over time.

**This Guide:**
- Explains how our community operates

**This Guide Is Not:**
- A fixed set of rules (we evolve)
- A legal contract (see the Operating Agreement for that)
- A substitute for direct community interaction
