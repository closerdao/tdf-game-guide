# Welcome to the TDF Game Guide

Welcome, dreamer 🐑

Whether you've just arrived or have been around since the chicken farm days, this guide is for you. It’s here to help you understand the culture, rules, processes, and magic of Traditional Dream Factory (TDF).

TDF is not just a place — it's a living, breathing prototype of a regenerative future. Together, we’re co-creating a new story of community, creativity, care, and land stewardship. This Game Guide is your handbook for playing along.


### 🌱 What is TDF?

Traditional Dream Factory is a regenerative village prototype based in Abela, Portugal. It’s the first land-based project of the OASA network — a web3-powered nature conservancy designed to empower regenerative living. 

TDF exists to prove that it’s possible to live joyfully, regeneratively, and cooperatively. It weaves together coliving, land stewardship, creative expression, and decentralized governance to form a “playground” for the future we want to live in.

It’s a place where:
- Work and rest dance together
- Governance happens through consent and contribution
- People collaborate with nature — not against it
- Tokens, tools, and technology support thriving ecosystems

### 🌍 What is the Game?

We’re playing the long game of regeneration — with land, people, and systems. This guide maps out how we:
- Make decisions together
- Share responsibilities and resources
- Cultivate rituals, habits, and magic
- Navigate governance and group living

It’s not about control. It’s about *coordination with consent.*

### 📖 What’s Inside?
This Game Guide includes:

### 🌀 A Living Document
This guide is never final. It evolves like a food forest — organically, in seasons, with contributions from many hands and hearts. Your feedback is welcomed and valued.

Let’s build the dream, together.

Welcome to the game 💫
