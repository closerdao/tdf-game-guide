A regenerative community and living laboratory in Abela, Portugal where players collaborate to create a thriving ecosystem for humans and nature.

### Is this really a game?
Yes and no! We use game mechanics and language to make regenerative living more engaging and accessible, but the impacts are very real.

No special skills required to start! Like any good game, you'll learn as you play. Bring curiosity, openness, and willingness to contribute.

The Regeneration Game is ongoing. Players can engage for days, weeks, or years depending on their character progression and interests.

Book a stay at TDF, complete the arrival quests, and begin contributing to the community. See [How to Play](how_to_play.md) for details.

### What's the difference between visiting and becoming a Citizen?
Visitors are temporary players exploring the game world. Citizens are committed players with governance rights and deeper responsibilities.

### Can I play remotely?
Some aspects of the game can be played remotely (like governance participation), but the core experience requires physical presence in the game world.

A blend of individual freedom and community engagement. Most days include some contribution time, shared meals, and free time for personal projects or relaxation.

## üí∞ TOKENS & ECONOMY

Utility tokens that grant stay rights (1 token = 1 night per year) and governance weight. See [Token Basics](../05_token-economy/token_basics.md).

### How do I earn $Sweat?
By contributing meaningful work to the community through projects, maintenance tasks, cooking, hosting, and other valuable activities.

### Is this a cryptocurrency project?
We use blockchain technology for transparency and governance, but our focus is regenerative living, not speculation or financial returns.

## üå± REGENERATIVE ASPECTS

### What makes this "regenerative"?
We aim to leave the land, community, and players better than we found them through ecological restoration, community building, and personal growth.
