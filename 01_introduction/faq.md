## üå± Community Basics

### What is TDF?
A regenerative community and living laboratory in Abela, Portugal where people collaborate to create a thriving ecosystem for humans and nature.

### Is this structured like a game?
Kind of. While we previously used some game-like language, our focus is on creating real-world regenerative systems. The community operates with transparent structures that anyone can understand and participate in.

### Do I need special skills to participate?
No special skills required! You'll learn as you participate. Bring curiosity, openness, and willingness to contribute.

### How long can I be involved?
Stays can be days, weeks, or years depending on your alignment with the community. Participation flexibility requires "playing the game" - active engagement in community life and following community protocols.

## üîÑ Participation

### How do I get involved?
Book a stay at TDF, complete the arrival process, and begin contributing to the community. See [Getting Started](getting_started.md) for details.

### What's the difference between visiting and becoming a Citizen?
Visitors are temporary participants exploring the community. Citizens are committed members with governance rights and deeper responsibilities.

### Can I participate remotely?
Some aspects of community life can be engaged with remotely (like governance participation), but the core experience requires physical presence at TDF.

### What does daily life look like?
A blend of individual freedom and community engagement. Most days include some contribution time, shared meals, and free time for personal projects or relaxation.

## üí∞ Tokens & Economy

### What are $TDF tokens?
Utility tokens that grant stay rights (1 token = 1 night per year) and governance weight. See [Token Basics](../05_token-economy/token_basics.md).

### How do I earn $Sweat?
Mainly earned through fixed monthly roles and skill-based residencies. You can also earn through contributing meaningful work to the community through projects, maintenance tasks, cooking, hosting, and other valuable activities.

### Is this a cryptocurrency project?
We use blockchain technology for transparency and governance, but our focus is regenerative living, not speculation or financial returns.

### Do I need to buy tokens to participate?
No! Visitors can experience TDF without tokens. Long-term engagement as a Citizen does require holding some $TDF tokens.
