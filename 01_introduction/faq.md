## üå± COMMUNITY BASICS

### What exactly is Traditional Dream Factory?
A regenerative community and living laboratory in Abela, Portugal where people collaborate to create a thriving ecosystem for humans and nature.

### Is this structured like a game?
Kind of. While we previously used some game-like language, our focus is on creating real-world regenerative systems. The community operates with transparent structures that anyone can understand and participate in.

### Do I need special skills to participate?
No special skills required to start! You'll learn as you participate. Bring curiosity, openness, and willingness to contribute.

### How long can I be involved?
The TDF community is ongoing. People can engage for days, weeks, or years depending on their level of interest and commitment.

## üîÑ PARTICIPATION

### How do I get involved?
Book a stay at TDF, complete the arrival process, and begin contributing to the community. See [Getting Started](getting_started.md) for details.

### What's the difference between visiting and becoming a Citizen?
Visitors are temporary participants exploring the community. Citizens are committed members with governance rights and deeper responsibilities.

### Can I participate remotely?
Some aspects of community life can be engaged with remotely (like governance participation), but the core experience requires physical presence at TDF.

### What does daily life look like?
A blend of individual freedom and community engagement. Most days include some contribution time, shared meals, and free time for personal projects or relaxation.

## üí∞ TOKENS & ECONOMY

### What are $TDF tokens?
Utility tokens that grant stay rights (1 token = 1 night per year) and governance weight. See [Token Basics](../05_token-economy/token_basics.md).

### How do I earn $Sweat?
By contributing meaningful work to the community through projects, maintenance tasks, cooking, hosting, and other valuable activities.

### Is this a cryptocurrency project?
We use blockchain technology for transparency and governance, but our focus is regenerative living, not speculation or financial returns.

### Do I need to buy tokens to participate?
No! Visitors can experience TDF without tokens. Long-term engagement as a Citizen does require holding some $TDF tokens.

## üè° PRACTICAL MATTERS

### Where is TDF located?
In Abela, Alentejo, Portugal‚Äîabout 2 hours south of Lisbon and 15 minutes from the coast.

### What accommodations are available?

Practical clothing for outdoor work, personal items, and an open mind. A detailed packing list is provided when you book.

### How do I get there?
Fly to Lisbon, then take a train to Gr√¢ndola or bus to Santiago do Cac√©m. We can arrange pickup from these stations.

## üå± REGENERATIVE ASPECTS

### What makes this "regenerative"?
We aim to leave the land, community, and participants better than we found them through ecological restoration, community building, and personal growth.

### How do you measure impact?
Through ecological monitoring, community feedback loops, and personal reflection. See [Monitoring](../07_land-stewardship/monitoring.md).

### Is this a cult?
No! We value diversity of thought, freedom of choice, and healthy boundaries. Community members are free to engage at their comfort level and depart anytime.

### How can I contribute my unique skills?
The community benefits from diverse skills! During orientation, we'll help you find ways to contribute that match your abilities and interests.
