### 📚 What This Guide Is (and Isn’t)

**It is:**
- A co-created guidebook for playing the “game of life” at TDF
- A way to learn the rules, roles, values, and responsibilities
- A reference for governance, contributions, and decision-making
- A growing container of shared wisdom

**It isn’t:**
- A static or final rulebook
- A legal contract (see the Operating Agreement for that)
- A replacement for human dialogue, curiosity, and consent
