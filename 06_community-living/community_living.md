# Community Living at TDF

Life at Traditional Dream Factory is a shared experiment in regenerative culture. We co-create rhythms, rituals, responsibilities â€” and leave space for magic, messiness, and growth.

This guide gives you a snapshot of what to expect and how to show up.

---

### ðŸ§¼ Shared Responsibilities
We all contribute to the daily flow of the space. That means:
- Participating in **food prep and clean-up rotations**
- Caring for shared spaces (kitchen, compost, bathrooms, common areas)
- Taking on a "fairy job" â€” a small stewardship task that brings beauty or order to the space
- Respecting kitchen systems and **washing your own dishes** if outside shared meal times

---

### ðŸ§’ Children & Families
- Kids are welcome and celebrated!
- Parents/guardians are responsible for their safety and well-being
- Children should be supported in learning the rhythms of community life
- Everyone is encouraged to support an intergenerational atmosphere of patience, curiosity, and inclusion

---

### ðŸ§˜ Wellness & Boundaries
- Quiet hours are respected, especially around sleeping areas
- Nudity is welcome in designated zones (e.g. sauna, pool) â€” always with **consent**
- Substances:
  - Alcohol is allowed in moderation and with **awareness** â€” no excessive intoxication
  - Cannabis and psychedelics may be used intentionally, not publicly, and always with **respect for group energy**
  - No hard drugs or reckless behavior allowed

---

### ðŸ—£ Consent & Communication
TDF is built on trust and interdependence:
- Always ask before touching, hugging, or entering someoneâ€™s space
- Use clear and direct communication â€” and listen deeply
- Conflict is natural: we transform it, not suppress it. Mediation support is available
- Practice giving and receiving feedback with kindness

---

### ðŸŽ¨ Culture & Play
We host regular:
- Sharing circles, sauna nights, celebrations, and jams
- Workshops, skillshares, and collaborative art
- Monthly themes curated by **Cultural Citizens**

Youâ€™re encouraged to:
- Initiate your own offerings
- Be spontaneous and co-create beauty

---

### ðŸ“– The Game Rules
Hereâ€™s a summary of essential community agreements:
- Respect everyoneâ€™s **bodily autonomy** and **consent**
- Contribute to shared meals and clean-up (if you're eating, you're helping)
- Keep kitchen and communal areas clean
- Use substances intentionally, never to escape or dominate space
- Nudity is welcome where appropriate, not performative
- Children are part of the community, not ignored or tokenized
- If you break something, clean it up or fix it
- Leave spaces **better than you found them**
- Ask for help. Offer help. Donâ€™t wait to be told

---

### ðŸ§³ When You Arrive
- Join the **daily check-in** or ask for a Steward to guide you
- Read the **Visitor Guide** and sync with ongoing tasks
- Ask how you can support the flow â€” there's always a way

Living at TDF is about finding your place in the ecology of community â€” and remembering: how you show up shapes the world around you ðŸŒ€
