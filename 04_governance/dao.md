# 🏛️ DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization)

**Digital Governance** The TDF DAO is our digital governance collective that enables community members to propose, vote on, and implement decisions collectively.

> *"Decentralized governance puts power in the hands of those who participate."*

## 🎯 Purpose

The DAO serves as the primary governance mechanism for TDF, enabling:

- **Collective Decision-Making** - Community members propose and vote on important decisions
- **Transparent Governance** - All proposals and votes are publicly recorded
- **Democratic Participation** - Every member has a voice in community direction
- **Resource Management** - Budget allocation and financial decisions
- **Policy Development** - Creating and updating community rules and procedures

## 🏗️ Structure

### DAO Members (Voting Rights)

The DAO is made up exclusively of:

- **Citizens** - Full community members with governance rights and voting power
- **Token Holders** - Individuals holding $TDF tokens with voting power proportional to their holdings

### Stakeholders (Non-Voting)

These groups participate as stakeholders but are not voting members of the DAO:

- **Team Members** - Operational leaders hired by the executive director
- **Sweat Earners** - Contributors who have earned $Sweat through major projects
- **Lenders** - Financial supporters providing capital

### Governance Process

1. **Proposal Creation** - Citizens create proposals via Charmverse
2. **Community Feedback** - 1-2 week comment period for refinement
3. **Voting** - Snapshot vote with weighted voting system
4. **Implementation** - Team executes approved decisions
5. **Monitoring** - Progress tracking and impact assessment

## 🗳️ Voting System

### Voting Weight Formula
```
Voting Power = ($TDF × 1) + ($Presence × 1) + ($Sweat × 5) + (Proof of Implementation × 1)
```
