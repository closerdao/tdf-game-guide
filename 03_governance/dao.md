# 🏛️ DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization)

**Project-Level Assembly** The TDF DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) is a project-level assembly within the larger OASA framework. It consists solely of TDF token holders who hold governance rights, with citizens as a subset of token holders with deeper responsibilities.

**Constitutional Authority** The DAO's authority is limited by the [OASA constitution](https://oasa.earth) and by OASA's guardians of nature. Major decisions such as amending masterplans, issuing tokens, or changing regeneration targets must comply with OASA's constitution and may require approval by OASA's General Meeting.

> *"Decentralized governance puts power in the hands of those who participate, within the bounds of ecological integrity."*

## 🎯 Purpose

The DAO serves as the primary governance mechanism for TDF, enabling:

- **Collective Decision-Making** - Token holders propose and vote on important decisions
- **Transparent Governance** - All proposals and votes are publicly recorded
- **Democratic Participation** - Every token holder has a voice in community direction
- **Resource Management** - Budget allocation and financial decisions
- **Policy Development** - Creating and updating community rules and procedures

## 🏗️ Structure

### DAO Members (Voting Rights)

The DAO consists solely of:

- **TDF Token Holders** - Individuals holding $TDF tokens with voting power proportional to their holdings
- **Citizens** - A subset of token holders with deeper responsibilities and additional governance rights

### External Stakeholders (Non-Voting)

These groups influence the project but do not participate in governance decisions:

- **Team Members** - Operational leaders hired by the executive director
- **Sweat Earners** - Contributors who have earned $Sweat through major projects (but do not hold voting tokens)
- **Lenders** - Financial supporters providing capital

### Governance Process

1. **Proposal Creation** - Citizens create proposals via Charmverse
2. **Community Feedback** - 1-2 week comment period for refinement
3. **Voting** - Snapshot vote with weighted voting system
4. **Implementation** - Team executes approved decisions
5. **Monitoring** - Progress tracking and impact assessment

## 🗳️ Voting System

### Voting Weight Formula
```
Voting Power = $TDF + $Presence + $Sweat
```

### Voting Requirements
- **Quorum** - 500 $TDF equivalent
- **Approval** - >50% of votes cast
- **Guardian Veto** - Guardians can veto ecological issues

## 🔗 Key Relationships

- **OASA** - Ecological oversight and constitutional principles
- **Team** - Day-to-day operational decisions
- **Enseada Sonhadora LDA** - Legal entity for land ownership
