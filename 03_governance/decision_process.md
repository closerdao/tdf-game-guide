|------|-------------|----------|-------------|
| **Do-ocracy** | Any Citizen | Rearranging kitchen space, starting a compost pile | Low Impact |
| **DAO Proposal** | TDF DAO | Budgeting for infrastructure, updating rules | Medium Impact |
| **Constitutional** | OASA General Meeting | Amending Principles, onboarding new projects | High Impact |
| **Executive** | Elected Team | Daily operations, guest management, payments | Operational |
| **Protected** | Outside TDF Authority | Land sales, profit distribution, core values | Restricted |
