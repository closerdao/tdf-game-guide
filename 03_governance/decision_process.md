# üé≤ Decision-Making Process

**COMMUNITY GOVERNANCE** At TDF, governance operates through three distinct decision layers, each with specific responsibilities and authority.

> *"The best decisions emerge when all voices are heard and valued."*

## üèõÔ∏è Three Decision Layers

### 1. OASA & Guardians
**Ecological oversight and constitutional principles**
- Ecological veto power for land-related decisions
- Constitutional principles and core values
- Environmental protection and regeneration standards
- Guardians appointed by OASA for ecological oversight

### 2. DAO
**Proposals, budgets, and elections**
- Community proposals and voting (by TDF token holders only)
- Budget allocation and financial decisions
- Election of executive team (legally represented by a director)
- Policy changes and rule updates
- Any changes to the game guide must be proposed on Charmverse and voted on via Snapshot (with guardians' veto for ecological issues)

**DAO Membership:** The DAO comprises TDF token holders; sweat earners and lenders are stakeholders with influence but do not hold voting rights.

### 3. Team (Executive Team)
**Day-to-day operational decisions**
- Daily operations and guest management
- Resource allocation within approved budgets
- Staff hiring and management
- Implementation of DAO decisions
- Emergency response and safety protocols

**Team Term Limits:** The executive team serves fixed terms of 6-12 months with mandatory renewal votes by the DAO. The team is legally represented by a director.

## üîÑ DAO DECISION PROCESS

The main governance process follows these steps:

1. **Proposal Crafting**
   - Created by a Citizen
   - Submitted via [Charmverse](https://charmverse.io)

   - Members offer insights and refinements
   - Proposal evolves through collaboration

3. **Refinement**
   - Proposal updated based on feedback
   - Optional roundtable discussions
   - Final version prepared for voting

4. **Voting Process**
   - Snapshot vote initiated
   - Quorum: 500 $TDF equivalent
   - Approval: >50% of votes cast
   - Voting weight formula applied
   - Guardians have veto power for ecological issues

5. **Implementation**
   - Team and Enseada Sonhadora execute

## üí∞ Budgeting Process

The DAO manages community finances through:

1. **Annual Budget Planning**
   - Executive director proposes annual budget
   - Community reviews and provides feedback
   - DAO votes on budget allocation

2. **Quarterly Reviews**
   - Financial performance assessment
   - Budget adjustments as needed
   - Transparency reports to community

   - Community evaluation of project value
   - DAO approval for project funding

4. **Emergency Funds**

   - Requires DAO approval for use
   - Transparent reporting on emergency expenditures

## ‚è∞ Director Term Limits

The executive director serves for a defined term with mandatory renewal:

- **Term Length** - 6-12 months with possibility of renewal
