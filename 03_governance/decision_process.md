# üé≤ Decision-Making Process

**COMMUNITY GOVERNANCE** At TDF, governance is a collaborative process where community members work together to shape the future.

> *"The best decisions emerge when all voices are heard and valued."*

## üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è DECISION TYPES

Different decisions follow different processes:

| TYPE | WHO DECIDES | EXAMPLES | IMPACT LEVEL |
|------|-------------|----------|-------------|
| **Do-ocracy** | Any Citizen | Rearranging kitchen space, starting a compost pile | Low Impact |
| **DAO Proposal** | TDF DAO | Budgeting for infrastructure, updating rules | Medium Impact |
| **Constitutional** | OASA General Meeting | Amending Principles, onboarding new projects | High Impact |
| **Executive** | Elected Team | Daily operations, guest management, payments | Operational |
| **Protected** | Outside TDF Authority | Land sales, profit distribution, core values | Restricted |

## üîÑ DAO DECISION PROCESS

The main governance process follows these steps:

1. **Proposal Crafting**
   - Created by a Citizen
   - Submitted via [Charmverse](https://charmverse.io)
   - Clear objectives and implementation plan

2. **Community Feedback**
   - 1-2 week comment period
   - Members offer insights and refinements
   - Proposal evolves through collaboration

3. **Refinement**
   - Proposal updated based on feedback
   - Optional roundtable discussions
   - Final version prepared for voting

4. **Voting Process**
   - Snapshot vote initiated
   - Quorum: 500 $TDF equivalent
   - Approval: >50% of votes cast
   - Voting weight formula applied

5. **Implementation**
   - Team and Enseada Sonhadora execute
   - Progress updates to community
   - Impact measured and shared

## üõ°Ô∏è PROTECTED AREAS

Some decisions are protected by special rules:

- **Principles** - Can only be changed through OASA General Meeting
- **Land Decisions** - Protected by legal guardians
- **Core Values** - Cannot be overridden by any governance process

## üéØ STRATEGIC TIPS

- **Build Consensus** - Strong proposals address concerns before voting
