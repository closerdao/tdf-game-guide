# üèõÔ∏è Governance

**Community Decision-Making** TDF operates through a multi-layered governance system that balances community participation with ecological oversight.

- [Guardians](../02_roles-and-stakeholders/guardian.md) - Ecological veto power, appointed by OASA
- Constitutional principles and core values aligned with [OASA constitution](https://oasa.earth)
- Environmental protection standards and regenerative principles

### 2. DAO
**Proposals, budgets, and elections**
- [DAO](dao.md) - Digital governance collective of TDF token holders
