# üèõÔ∏è Governance

**Decision-Making** TDF operates through unique decision-making processes that balance power, participation, and purpose.

> *"Governance isn't a chore‚Äîit's where we shape our shared future."*

## üîÑ Core Processes

The governance system at TDF combines several approaches:

- **Do-ocracy** - Take action without permission when impact is reversible
- **Consent-Based Decisions** - Proposals pass unless there are substantiated objections
- **Token-Weighted Voting** - Governance weight based on tokens, presence, and contribution
- **DAO Structure** - Decentralized Autonomous Organization of citizens, token holders, team, sweat earners, and lenders

## üèõÔ∏è DAO Structure

The DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) includes:
- **Citizens** - Full community members with governance rights
- **Token Holders** - Individuals holding TDF tokens
- **Team Members** - Operational leaders elected by the DAO
- **Sweat Earners** - Community members earning through contributions
- **Lenders** - Financial supporters providing capital
