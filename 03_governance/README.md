# üèõÔ∏è GAME MECHANICS

**FORGE YOUR DESTINY!** The Regeneration Game operates through unique decision-making mechanics that balance power, participation, and purpose.

> *"In this game, governance isn't a chore‚Äîit's where the real magic happens."*

## üéÆ CORE MECHANICS

The governance system at TDF combines several powerful mechanics:

- **Do-ocracy** - Take action without permission when impact is reversible
- **Consent-Based Decisions** - Proposals pass unless there are substantiated objections
- **Token-Weighted Voting** - Governance weight based on tokens, presence, and contribution
- **Delegation** - Empower other players to vote on your behalf
