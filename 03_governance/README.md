# üèõÔ∏è Governance

**Decision-Making** TDF operates through unique decision-making processes that balance power, participation, and purpose.

> *"Governance isn't a chore‚Äîit's where we shape our shared future."*

## üîÑ Core Processes

The governance system at TDF combines several approaches:

- **Do-ocracy** - Take action without permission when impact is reversible
- **Consent-Based Decisions** - Proposals pass unless there are substantiated objections
- **Token-Weighted Voting** - Governance weight based on tokens, presence, and contribution
- **Delegation** - Empower other members to vote on your behalf
