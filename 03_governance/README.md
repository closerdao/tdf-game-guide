# 🏛️ Governance

**Decision-Making** TDF operates through unique decision-making processes that balance power, participation, and purpose.

> *"Governance isn't a chore—it's where we shape our shared future."*

## 🔄 Core Processes

The governance system at TDF combines several approaches:

- **Do-ocracy** - Take action without permission when impact is reversible
- **Consent-Based Decisions** - Proposals pass unless there are substantiated objections
- **Token-Weighted Voting** - Governance weight based on tokens, presence, and contribution
- **DAO Structure** - Decentralized Autonomous Organization of citizens and token holders

## 🏛️ DAO Structure

The DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) is made up exclusively of:
- **Citizens** - Full community members with governance rights and voting power
- **Token Holders** - Individuals holding TDF tokens with voting power proportional to their holdings

### Stakeholders (Non-Voting)
These groups participate as stakeholders but are not voting members of the DAO:
- **Team Members** - Operational leaders hired by the executive director
- **Sweat Earners** - Contributors who have earned $Sweat through major projects
- **Lenders** - Financial supporters providing capital

- **Principles** - Can only be changed through OASA General Meeting
- **Land Decisions** - Protected by legal guardians and stewards
- **Core Values** - Cannot be overridden by any governance process
