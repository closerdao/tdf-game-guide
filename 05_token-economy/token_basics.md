## ‚ö†Ô∏è BOUNDARY CONDITIONS

$TDF is explicitly NOT:
- A share in land or physical assets
- A financial investment or security
- A profit-generating instrument
- A speculative asset

## üß™ EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN

$TDF is designed as an experimental token that:
- Supports transparent project funding
- Aligns incentives with regenerative outcomes
- Creates a circular economy of value and care
- Enables decentralized governance

## üîÑ THE RENEWAL CYCLE

$TDF tokens grant stay rights that follow a natural cycle:

- **1 Token = 1 Night** of stay per 365-day period
- **365-Day Reset** - Tokens become reusable for booking after 365 days have passed
- **No Rollover** - Unused nights don't carry over to the next period

### System Dynamics

The renewal system creates several interesting dynamics:

- **Use It or Lose It** - Encourages regular engagement with the land
- **Predictable Capacity** - Helps plan infrastructure and resources
- **Shared Access** - Prevents hoarding of stay rights
- **Sustainable Usage** - Aligns with the land's carrying capacity

### Technical Implementation

The renewal system is implemented through:

- **Smart Contract Logic** - Tracks usage rights per token per year
- **Booking System Integration** - Verifies token ownership for stays
- **Annual Reset Function** - Automatically refreshes stay rights

### Strategic Considerations

Members should consider several factors in their token strategy:

- **Seasonal Planning** - Different seasons offer different experiences
- **Token Quantity** - How many nights you wish to stay each year
- **Usage Patterns** - Regular short visits vs. longer seasonal stays

## üîÆ PRACTICAL EXAMPLES

| SCENARIO                                  | MECHANISM                     | OUTCOME                                           |
| ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **Hold 10 tokens, stay 5 nights**         | 5/10 rights used              | 5 unused rights expire after 365 days             |
| **Hold 5 tokens, want to stay 10 nights** | Need to acquire 5 more tokens | Purchase or earn additional tokens                |
| **Hold 20 tokens, can't visit this year** | 0/20 rights used              | All rights expire after 365 days, but tokens retain future value |
