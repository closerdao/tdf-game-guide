# Token Basics at TDF

TDF uses a utility token called **$TDF** to support its operations, incentivize contributions, and enable decentralized governance. It is not an investment vehicle or security — it’s a way to play the game and participate in the commons.

### 🎟 What is the $TDF Token?
A **utility token** that grants:
- 1 night of stay per token per year (at utility cost)
- Governance rights (if you are a Citizen)
- A mechanism to earn, contribute, and co-create

---

### ⚠️ What It Is Not
- Not a share in land or assets
- No dividends, profits, or financial return
- Not a security or equity token

---

### 🧪 Experimental, Not Speculative
$TDF is designed to:
- Support transparent project funding (via bonding curve)
- Reflect usage and participation in a regenerative ecosystem
- Align value with care, creativity, and contribution — not extraction
