# Annual Renewal of Token Utility

The $TDF Token is a **regenerative utility token** — it renews annually and reflects the ecological limits and carrying capacity of the land.

---

### 🔁 How Token Utility Works
- Each $TDF Token grants **1 night of stay per year**
- Utility is **not cumulative** — unused nights do not roll over
- Token utility resets every 12 months

---

### 📆 When Is the Reset?
- Annual renewal is tied to the DAO’s defined **"season cycle"** (typically from the "go-live" event date)
- Citizens are notified when new cycles begin

---

### 🧾 Booking with Tokens
- Use tokens to book stays **at utility cost** (i.e., cost to run the space)
- Bookings are subject to availability and must follow the guidelines in the Visitor Guide

---

### 🧠 Why Not Roll Over?
- To prevent over-accumulation or speculative hoarding
- To reflect the **regenerative logic**: use what you need, when you need
- To keep token usage aligned with real-world capacity and care

This system helps keep the Factory human-scale, ecologically grounded, and continuously accessible 💫
