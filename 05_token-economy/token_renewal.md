# üîÑ TOKEN RENEWAL

**ANNUAL CYCLES** In the TDF community, $TDF tokens follow a unique annual cycle that keeps the economy dynamic and sustainable.

> *"Like the seasons, our tokens renew‚Äîensuring resources flow where they're needed most."*

## üå± THE RENEWAL CYCLE

$TDF tokens grant stay rights that follow a natural cycle:

- **1 Token = 1 Night** of stay per calendar year
- **Annual Reset** on a fixed date (January 1st)
- **No Rollover** to subsequent years

## üîÑ SYSTEM DYNAMICS

The renewal system creates several interesting dynamics:

- **Use It or Lose It** - Encourages regular engagement with the land
- **Predictable Capacity** - Helps plan infrastructure and resources
- **Shared Access** - Prevents hoarding of stay rights
- **Sustainable Usage** - Aligns with the land's carrying capacity

## ‚öôÔ∏è TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION

The renewal system is implemented through:

- **Smart Contract Logic** - Tracks usage rights per token per year
- **Booking System Integration** - Verifies token ownership for stays
- **Annual Reset Function** - Automatically refreshes stay rights

## üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è STRATEGIC CONSIDERATIONS

Members should consider several factors in their token strategy:

- **Seasonal Planning** - Different seasons offer different experiences
- **Token Quantity** - How many nights you wish to stay each year
- **Usage Patterns** - Regular short visits vs. longer seasonal stays
- **Delegation** - Allowing others to use your stay rights

## üîÆ PRACTICAL EXAMPLES

| SCENARIO                                  | MECHANISM                     | OUTCOME                                           |
| ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **Hold 10 tokens, stay 5 nights**         | 5/10 rights used              | 5 unused rights expire at year end                |
| **Hold 5 tokens, want to stay 10 nights** | Need to acquire 5 more tokens | Purchase or earn additional tokens                |
| **Hold 20 tokens, can't visit this year** | 0/20 rights used              | All rights expire, but tokens retain future value |
| **Hold 3 tokens, friend needs a place**   | Delegate usage rights         | Friend can stay using your tokens                 |

*"The renewal cycle ensures that our tokens remain in flow, just like nature itself."*
