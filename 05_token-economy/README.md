# ðŸ’° Community Token System

**Overview** The TDF community uses three token types to track participation, enable governance, and manage resources.

## ðŸª™ Token Types

| Token | Purpose | Properties |
|-------|---------|------------|
| **$TDF** | Core utility token | Transferable, represents stay rights and governance |
| **[$Presence](./\$presence.md)** | Attendance tracker | Non-transferable, decreasing over time, time-weighted |
| **[$Sweat](./\$sweat.md)** | Contribution tracker | Non-transferable, decreasing over time, effort-weighted |

## ðŸ“Š Token Functions

These tokens work together in our community:

- **Governance Weight** = ($TDF Ã— 1) + ($Presence Ã— 1) + ($Sweat Ã— 5)
- **Stay Rights** = 1 $TDF = 1 night per year at utility cost
- **Contribution Tracking** = Work â†’ $Sweat + $TDF
