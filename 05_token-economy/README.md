# ðŸ’° Community Token System

**OASA-Aligned Overview** The TDF community uses three token types to track participation, enable governance, and manage resources within the [OASA constitutional framework](https://oasa.earth).

**Constitutional Compliance**: All token issuance and economic decisions must comply with the [OASA constitution](https://oasa.earth) and may require approval by OASA's General Meeting for major changes.

## ðŸª™ Token Types

| Token | Purpose | Properties |
|-------|---------|------------|
| **$TDF** | Core utility token | Transferable, represents stay rights and governance |
| **[$Presence](./\$presence.md)** | Attendance tracker | Non-transferable, decreasing over time, time-weighted |
| **[$Sweat](./\$sweat.md)** | Contribution tracker | Non-transferable, decreasing over time, effort-weighted |

## ðŸ“Š Token Functions

These tokens work together in our community:

- **Governance Weight** = ($TDF Ã— 1) + ($Presence Ã— 1) + ($Sweat Ã— 5) + (Proof of Implementation Ã— 1)
- **Stay Rights** = 1 $TDF = 1 night per year at utility cost
- **Contribution Tracking** = Work â†’ $Sweat + $TDF

## ðŸ¥• Carrots (Stay Credits)

Citizens can earn stay credits called "carrots" through volunteering:
- **One-time Credits** - Can be gifted or used to extend stays
- **Non-renewable** - Carrots don't renew annually and do not accumulate
- **Volunteering Reward** - Earned through community service
- **Giftable** - Can be transferred to other community members
- **Usage** - Can be used to extend stays beyond normal limits

**Examples of carrot usage:**
- Extending a stay by a few days
- Gifting a stay credit to a friend
- Using credits for special events or workshops
