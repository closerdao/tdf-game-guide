# ðŸ’° Community Token System

## Overview from the OASA Whitepaper

The TDF token economy operates within the broader OASA framework, implementing regenerative economic principles through a multi-token system. Our approach emphasizes utility over speculation, with tokens designed to track meaningful participation, enable decentralized governance, and support ecological restoration. The system creates circular value flows where community contributions directly translate into governance influence and access rights, aligning individual incentives with collective regenerative outcomes.

**Overview** The TDF community uses three token types to track participation, enable governance, and manage resources.

**Constitutional Compliance**: All token issuance and economic decisions must comply with the [OASA constitution](https://oasa.earth) and may require approval by OASA's General Meeting for major changes.

## ðŸª™ Token Types

| Token | Purpose | Properties |
|-------|---------|------------|
| **$TDF** | Core utility token | Transferable, represents stay rights and governance |
| **[$Presence](./\$presence.md)** | Attendance tracker | Non-transferable, decreasing over time, time-weighted |
| **[$Sweat](./\$sweat.md)** | Contribution tracker | Non-transferable, decreasing over time, effort-weighted |

## ðŸ“Š Token Functions

These tokens work together in our community:

- **Governance Weight** = $TDF + $Presence + $Sweat
- **Stay Rights** = 1 $TDF = 1 night per year at utility cost
- **Contribution Tracking** = Work â†’ $Sweat + $TDF

## ðŸ¥• Carrots (Stay Credits)

Citizens can earn stay credits called "carrots" through volunteering:
- **One-time Credits** - Can be gifted or used to extend stays
- **Non-renewable** - Carrots don't renew annually
- **Volunteering Reward** - Earned through community service
- **Giftable** - Can be transferred to other community members
- **Usage** - Can be used to extend stays beyond normal limits

**Examples of carrot usage:**
- Extending a stay by a few days
- Gifting a stay credit to a friend
- Using credits for special events or workshops
