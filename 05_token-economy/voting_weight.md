# üó≥Ô∏è VOTING WEIGHT

**BALANCED PARTICIPATION** In the TDF Game, your governance power comes from a unique formula that balances different forms of contribution.

> *"True power comes not just from what you own, but from how you show up."*

## üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è THE POWER FORMULA

Your voting weight combines three magical elements:

```
Voting Power = ($TDF √ó 1) + ($Presence √ó 1) + ($Sweat √ó 5)
```

This formula ensures that active contributors have significant say in governance, even with fewer tokens.

## üéÆ POWER DYNAMICS

| CONTRIBUTION | WEIGHT | PHILOSOPHY |
|--------------|--------|------------|
| **$TDF Tokens** | 1√ó | Financial skin in the game |
| **$Presence** | 1√ó | Physical presence and time investment |
| **$Sweat** | 5√ó | Active work and meaningful contribution |

## ‚öñÔ∏è BALANCING FORCES

This weighted system creates several powerful effects:

- **Contribution > Capital** - Active players have more say than passive investors
- **Presence Matters** - Being physically present increases your influence
- **Work Is Valued** - Your sweat equity translates to governance power
- **Balanced Inputs** - Multiple paths to gaining influence in the game

## üéØ STRATEGIC GAMEPLAY

Different player strategies for gaining voting weight:

- **Token Holder** - Acquire and hold $TDF tokens
- **Resident** - Maximize physical presence on the land
- **Contributor** - Complete bounties and projects to earn $Sweat
- **Balanced Player** - Combine all three approaches for maximum impact
