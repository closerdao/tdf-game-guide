# üó≥Ô∏è Voting Weight

**HOW GOVERNANCE WORKS** The TDF community uses a voting weight formula that balances different forms of participation.

## üìä VOTING FORMULA

```
Voting Power = ($TDF √ó 1) + ($Presence √ó 1) + ($Sweat √ó 5)
```

This formula ensures active contributors have meaningful input in governance decisions.

## üî¢ TOKEN WEIGHTS

| TOKEN TYPE | WEIGHT | RATIONALE |
|------------|--------|-----------|
| **$TDF** | 1√ó | Financial participation |
| **$Presence** | 1√ó | Physical presence |
| **$Sweat** | 5√ó | Active contribution |

## ‚öñÔ∏è BALANCING PRINCIPLES

This system creates:

- **Contribution Focus** - Active participation has significant impact
- **Presence Value** - Being physically present matters
- **Work Recognition** - Contributions are valued in governance
- **Multiple Paths** - Different ways to participate in decision-making

## üìà PARTICIPATION APPROACHES

Different ways to gain voting weight:

- Holding $TDF tokens
- Spending time at TDF
- Contributing work and skills
- Combining all three approaches

## üßÆ EXAMPLES

| PARTICIPANT TYPE | $TDF | $PRESENCE | $SWEAT | TOTAL VOTING WEIGHT |
|------------------|------|-----------|--------|---------------------|
| New Visitor      | 10   | 0         | 0      | 10                  |
| Token Holder     | 100  | 0         | 0      | 100                 |
| Regular Resident | 20   | 30        | 0      | 50                  |
| Active Volunteer | 20   | 10        | 30     | 180                 |
| Balanced Citizen | 50   | 20        | 20     | 170                 |

## üîÑ DELEGATION

You can delegate your voting power to others:
- You keep ownership of your tokens
- Voting rights transfer temporarily
- You can revoke delegation when needed
