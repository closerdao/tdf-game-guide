# 🏆 TOKEN DISTRIBUTION

**CLAIM YOUR SHARE!** The $TDF token supply is carefully balanced to support the game's regenerative economy and physical capacity.

> *"Every token represents a night under the stars and a voice in our shared future."*

## 🎯 SUPPLY MECHANICS

The total $TDF supply is designed with purpose:

- **Total Supply: 18,600 Tokens**
- Based on TDF's projected capacity for annual stays
- Represents sustainable usage of the land and facilities

## 🧮 DISTRIBUTION FORMULA

| CATEGORY | ALLOCATION | PURPOSE |
|----------|------------|---------|
| **Public Sale** | 80% (14,880) | Community ownership through transparent bonding curve |
| **Sweat Reserve** | 20% (3,720) | Rewards for contributors and Citizens |

## 📈 BONDING CURVE MAGIC

The bonding curve creates a transparent, algorithmic pricing model:

- **Dynamic Pricing** - Price increases as more tokens are purchased
- **Early Support** - Rewards early believers in the project
- **Sustainable Funding** - Generates resources for development
- **Exit Liquidity** - Provides a path for token holders to exit

```
Price = BasePrice + (Supply^2 / Scaling Factor)
```

## 🔒 VESTING & UNLOCKING

Tokens follow a careful release schedule:

- **Pre-Launch** - Tokens purchased before go-live are locked
- **Go-Live** - Unlocked when initial roadmap is complete
- **Transferability** - Subject to applicable regulations
- **Annual Renewal** - Stay rights reset each year (non-rollover)

## 🎮 ACQUISITION QUESTS

Ways to acquire $TDF tokens:

- **Purchase** - Buy directly through the bonding curve
- **Earn** - Complete bounties and receive from Sweat Reserve
- **Receive** - Gifts from other players or the DAO
- **Delegate** - Borrow voting power (not token ownership)
