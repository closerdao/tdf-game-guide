# Governance Rights of Token Holders

$TDF Tokens play a role in decision-making â€” but only when paired with **Citizenship**.

Simply holding tokens doesnâ€™t grant you the right to vote or participate in governance unless youâ€™re also an active Citizen.

Voting Weight =
- 1 point per Token held
- 5 points per Proof of Presence unit
- 5 points per Proof of Sweat unit

### ðŸ›  What You Can Vote On
As a Citizen holding tokens, you can vote on:
- Budget allocations
- New proposals and project ideas
- Governance and policy changes
- Elections for the Team and DAO representatives

### ðŸ”’ What You *Cannot* Vote On
