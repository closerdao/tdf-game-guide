# üí™ $Sweat Token

**CONTRIBUTION TRACKER** The $Sweat token transforms your work into lasting impact‚Äîa record of your contributions to the TDF community.

> *"Every contribution you make to the land becomes recognized in our system."*

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Implementation Status

**The $Sweat token is not yet being distributed and isn't fully implemented yet.** This page describes the planned functionality and design principles for when the system goes live.

## üß™ TOKEN PROPERTIES

$Sweat is a special token with unique characteristics:

- **Non-transferable** - Cannot be transferred or traded to other members
- **Effort-Weighted** - Represents real work and meaningful contribution
- **Decaying** - Gradually decreases over time, encouraging continued engagement
- **Verifiable** - Cryptographically secured proof of your contributions

## üîÑ HOW IT WORKS

### Earning $Sweat
$Sweat is earned by Team Members & Residents, although the team can choose to distribute to contractors (external team) and to anyone contributing work to the project, at the discretion of the team within reasonable limits. Note that 20% of the tokens are earmarked for sweat reserve.

- **Defined Major Projects** - Large-scale infrastructure, building, land restoration
- **Special Initiatives** - Community-wide projects with significant impact
- **Bounties** - Specific tasks with clear deliverables and compensation

### Using $Sweat
- **Governance Weight Amplification** - $Sweat is a supplementary metric that amplifies a token holder's governance weight but is not a separate membership class
- **Voting Power Enhancement** - Sweat tokens increase a token holder's influence in decision-making but do not grant voting rights on their own
- **Skill Recognition** - Visible indicator of your contribution areas
- **Community Recognition** - Acknowledgment of your ongoing commitment

## üßÆ DECAY FORMULA

$Sweat decays over time to encourage continued engagement:

```
decayedAmount = initialAmount * (1 - decayRatePerDay)^daysSinceContribution
```

Decay Rate: 10% annually (approximately 0.03%/day)

## üèÜ CONTRIBUTION TYPES
