# 🌱 TDF Game Guide 🌱
## Traditional Dream Factory

**Welcome** to the TDF Game Guide. This guide is your map to our regenerative human habitat—a living experiment where we play at building a different future.

## 🌱 Why We Exist

TDF exists because our current ways of living are unsustainable.
Land is degraded, communities are fragmented, and economies are built on extraction rather than regeneration. We believe another way is not only possible, but necessary.

## 🎯 Mission Statement

Traditional Dream Factory exists to reimagine how humans live together on Earth.
Our mission is to regenerate land, foster resilient communities, and prototype the economies and cultures of a thriving future.

## 🌱 Part of OASA

TDF is part of the OASA network and follows its regenerative constitution.
This means stewarding land as commons, rejecting extractive systems, and ensuring our local governance aligns with [OASA constitution](https://oasa.earth) and its regenerative principles. Certain key decisions remain subject to OASA’s General Meeting and guardians of nature.

## 📖 About This Guide

This Game Guide is a living rulebook that governs the "game" of TDF. It describes how community roles, governance and systems work, and invites participation in shaping and updating the rules via the DAO. The guide encourages people to see it as a dynamic tool: not fixed rules but a framework that evolves as we learn.
