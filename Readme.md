**Traditional Dream Factory** isn't just a place in Portugal—it's a living game world where players (like you!) collaborate to create a regenerative future. This isn't about virtual points or digital badges—it's about real-world impact, community building, and ecological restoration.

### YOUR QUEST

- Humans and nature flourish together in harmony

- Decisions emerge through consent and contribution
