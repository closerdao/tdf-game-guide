# 🌍 TDF Stewardships: Learning by Living

**Stewardships** are immersive 12-week learning journeys hosted at Traditional Dream Factory — designed to prepare the next generation of regenerative builders, organizers, technologists, and stewards of life.

More than a course, each stewardship is a **co-created experience** where participants integrate into the living organism of a regenerative village.

---

## ✨ What Are Stewardships?
A hybrid between a residency, a workshop series, and a build crew — stewardships offer structured learning around weekly themes, paired with hands-on contributions inside TDF’s operational systems.

You live, learn, and build — together.

## 🎓 What You'll Do
- **Daily Practice**: 4–6 hours/day of land-based or operational contribution
- **Team Integration**: Choose your track — Land, Kitchen, Meta, Construction
- **Weekly Workshops**: Learn from visiting tutors and TDF elders
- **Community Life**: Participate in governance, rituals, care work, and festivals
- **Project Participation**: Contribute to builds like biopools, food forests, or open-source infrastructure
