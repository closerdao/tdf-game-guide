## ðŸŒ± Key Stakeholders

The community is influenced by various stakeholders, each with their own interests and responsibilities:

- **DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization)** - Digital governance collective of citizens, token holders, team, sweat earners, and lenders
- **OASA** - The legal entity that holds the land
- **Investors/Lenders** - Financial supporters who provide capital for community development
- **Local Community** - Neighbors and allies in the surrounding region
- **Nature Itself** - The ultimate stakeholder we serve

## ðŸŒ³ Guardian Role

Guardians are external stakeholders tied to OASA principles, sometimes supported by AI ecological agents. They provide constitutional/ecological veto power and are placed at the bottom of the roles menu due to their special external status.
