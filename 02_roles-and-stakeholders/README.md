## ðŸ”„ Multiple Roles

**People can occupy multiple roles simultaneously** (e.g., citizen + resident, citizen + steward, team member + steward). Roles describe modes of participation rather than exclusive identities, allowing for flexible engagement based on individual capacity and community needs.

**Examples of role overlaps:**

- **Citizen + Steward** - A citizen who becomes a land steward for a season
- **Team Member + Steward** - A team member who also manages a specific area
- **Visitor + Volunteer** - A visitor who decides to volunteer during their stay

## ðŸŒ³ Guardian Role

**OASA-Appointed Ecological Representatives** Guardians are individuals appointed by OASA to uphold ecological integrity and represent the rights of water, soil, air, fauna, and flora. They operate independently of the DAO and answer to OASA's General Meeting.

**Constitutional Authority** As defined in the [OASA constitution](https://oasa.earth), guardians have the authority to flag or veto decisions that could harm ecological integrity. [Learn more about guardians â†’](guardian.md)
