- **Investors/Lenders** - Financial supporters who provide capital for community development

### Local Community

Individuals can hold multiple roles simultaneously (e.g., citizen + resident, team member + steward). Roles describe modes of participation rather than exclusive identities, allowing for flexible engagement based on individual capacity and community needs.

## ðŸŒ³ Guardian Role

Guardians are external stakeholders under OASA oversight, not daily community members. They hold ecological veto power and may be appointed by OASA to ensure constitutional principles are maintained. [Learn more about guardians â†’](guardian.md)
