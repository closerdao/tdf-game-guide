## What Are Stewardships?

A hybrid between a residency, a workshop series, and a build crew â€” stewardships offer structured learning around weekly themes, paired with hands-on contributions inside TDF's operational systems.

You live, learn, and build â€” together.

## What You'll Do

- **Daily Practice**: 4â€“6 hours/day of land-based or operational contribution
- **Team Integration**: Choose your track â€” Land, Kitchen, Meta, Construction
- **Weekly Workshops**: Learn from visiting tutors and TDF elders
- **Community Life**: Participate in governance, rituals, care work, and festivals
- **Project Participation**: Contribute to builds like biopools, food forests, or open-source infrastructure

## Example Topics Covered

While each season is co-designed with the cohort, common themes include:

- Soil restoration, swales & syntropic design
- Decentralized governance & token economics
- Mushroom cultivation & bioconstruction
- Consent, care, and conflict transformation
- BioPools, rewilding, and water system design
- Operating a regenerative kitchen
- Designing cultural programming and ritual
- Network building & regenerative economics

Tutors are invited to address real-time needs and steward requests.

## Who Should Apply

Stewardships are ideal for:
- Future village or coliving founders
- Land stewards & designers
- ReFi and Web3 contributors
- Artists, educators, builders, chefs, mystics

If you're called to regenerate land, culture, and systems â€” you belong.
We welcome all identities, backgrounds, and intelligences (yes, including silicon-based lifeforms).
