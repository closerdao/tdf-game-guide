# Citizenship Duties at TDF

Being a Citizen at Traditional Dream Factory means contributing actively to the health of the whole system — the land, the people, and the process.

With the privilege of participation comes shared responsibility. Here’s what’s expected of Citizens:

---

### ⏳ Presence
- Spend at least **14 days at TDF every 2 years** to remain an active Citizen
- Log your stay to accumulate **Proof of Presence**, which increases your governance power

---

### 🛠 Contribution
- Participate in **1–2 land or community projects** when on-site
- These might include: gardening, infrastructure maintenance, event hosting, documentation, care roles, etc.

---

### 📞 Participation
- Join at least **1 Citizens call per season** (online or hybrid)
- Stay updated through governance threads, Charmverse, or email summaries

---

### 📜 Alignment
- Abide by the:
  - **This Game Guide** (TDF’s constitution)
  - **Visitor Guide** (on-site rituals and rhythms)
  - **Principles of Regeneration and Land Stewardship** (OASA’s guiding ethics)

---

### 🫂 Culture Building
- Support new Citizens through the **vouching process**
- Engage in **conflict transformation** when tensions arise
- Model values like consent, inclusion, transparency, and care

---

Being a Citizen is less about holding a title — and more about holding the community.
Thank you for showing up 🙏
