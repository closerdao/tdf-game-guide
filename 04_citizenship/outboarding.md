# Citizenship Outboarding at TDF

Just as we welcome people with intention, we also release them with care.
Outboarding is the process through which someone may lose or step back from their Citizen status at Traditional Dream Factory.

It’s never a punishment — it’s an invitation to reflect, evolve, and return with clarity when ready.

---

### 🌬 Voluntary Outboarding
You can step back from Citizenship at any time by:
- Notifying the **Community Curator**
- Surrendering governance access and rights
- Remaining welcome as a guest or visitor (unless otherwise agreed)

---

### ⏳ Inactivity
Citizenship expires automatically if:
- You haven’t spent **14+ days at TDF in the last 2 years**
- You haven’t participated in **any Citizens calls or governance processes**

Inactive Citizens may be removed from governance platforms and must reapply to rejoin.

---

### ⚠️ Breach of Values or Agreements
If a Citizen seriously breaches TDF’s values, agreements, or the Principles:
1. **Conflict Transformation** is offered first (dialogue, mediation, repair)
2. A **Mitigation Plan** may be proposed by the Citizen
3. If unresolved, an **Unvouching Vote** is triggered
4. A **Learning Circle** may follow to reflect, integrate, and adapt

---

### 💚 Return is Possible
Former Citizens may reapply by going through onboarding again. We believe in growth, redemption, and the regenerative cycle of community life.

Outboarding isn’t the end — it’s a moment of transition 🌱
